Project 1: VPC and Networking
Problem Statement:
Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones. Deploy a NAT Gateway in the public subnet to allow instances in the private subnet to access the internet. Ensure secure communication and proper routing between subnets.

Project 2: EC2 Instances and Autoscaling
Problem Statement:
Deploy an auto-scaling group of EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). Configure CloudWatch Alarms to scale the instances based on CPU utilization. Use an Elastic File System (EFS) for shared storage among instances.

Project 3: Serverless Application
Problem Statement:
Build a serverless application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. Create an API with multiple endpoints using API Gateway that triggers Lambda functions, which interact with DynamoDB to store and retrieve data.

Project 4: Containerized Application with ECS
Problem Statement:
Deploy a containerized application using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate. Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic to ECS tasks. Ensure the infrastructure is highly available and scalable.

Project 5: Static Website Hosting with S3 and CloudFront
Problem Statement:
Host a static website on Amazon S3 and serve it via Amazon CloudFront for global distribution. Configure Route 53 for domain name management and set up an SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for HTTPS.

Project 6: Data Processing Pipeline
Problem Statement:
Create a data processing pipeline using AWS services. Use S3 for data storage, Lambda for processing incoming data, and Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for storing processed data. Set up monitoring and alerting using CloudWatch.

Project 7: CI/CD Pipeline with CodePipeline and CodeBuild
Problem Statement:
Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild. The pipeline should automatically deploy changes to an S3 bucket hosting a static website or to an ECS cluster.

Project 8: IAM Policies and Role Management
Problem Statement:
Implement a detailed IAM policy and role management system. Create roles for different services, such as EC2, Lambda, and RDS, with least privilege permissions. Implement policies for user groups with varying levels of access.

Project 9: Multi-Tier Application
Problem Statement:
Deploy a multi-tier application with a frontend (hosted on EC2 instances behind an ELB), a backend (running on ECS or Lambda), and a database layer (using RDS or DynamoDB). Ensure secure communication between tiers and implement autoscaling.

Project 10: Monitoring and Logging with CloudWatch and CloudTrail
Problem Statement:
Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging for your AWS infrastructure. Use CloudWatch for metrics and alarms, CloudTrail for auditing and logging API calls, and configure centralized logging using AWS Lambda and an S3 bucket.

Project 11: Backup and Disaster Recovery
Problem Statement:
Implement a backup and disaster recovery plan for an AWS environment. Use AWS Backup to manage backups of RDS, EFS, and EC2 instances. Create a disaster recovery strategy using cross-region replication and automated failover.

Project 12: Data Lake with AWS Glue and Athena
Problem Statement:
Create a data lake using S3, AWS Glue, and Athena. Use Glue to catalog and transform data stored in S3, and use Athena to query the data. Implement proper security and access controls using IAM and bucket policies.

Project 13: AWS WAF and Shield for Security
Problem Statement:
Implement AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) and AWS Shield to protect a web application hosted on AWS. Configure WAF rules to filter malicious traffic and use Shield to protect against DDoS attacks.

Project 14: Multi-Region Deployment
Problem Statement:
Deploy an application across multiple AWS regions to achieve high availability and disaster recovery. Use Route 53 for DNS failover, replicate databases using cross-region replication, and ensure the application is resilient to regional failures.

Project 15: Machine Learning Model Deployment
Problem Statement:
Deploy a machine learning model using AWS SageMaker. Train the model on a dataset stored in S3, deploy the trained model to an endpoint, and create a Lambda function that interacts with the SageMaker endpoint to provide predictions.

These projects will help you demonstrate a wide range of skills and expertise in using Terraform with AWS services, which will be valuable for your portfolio.
